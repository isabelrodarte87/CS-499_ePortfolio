### Artifact Information

The appointment service application was developed in CS-320 Software Test Automation and QA. Appointment Service is an application used to search clients' information such as appointment ID, date, and description, add an appointment, and delete an appointment. Users can update client information, including deleting and adding new clients. The enhancement for this artifact is that this appointment service is unsuitable for any company to use as it does not house/store information. The Appointment Service artifact is excellent for demonstrating my database abilities in a project.

### The Enhancement

### Meeting Course Objective 

The course objective I plan to meet includes innovative techniques and skills I completed during this enhancement. I had to be familiar with database modeling, SQL, and design proficiency to construct the database. These techniques and skills are essential in computer science and programming. I want to add GUI features to improve user experience by providing access in a user-friendly window. The GUI feature would allow for this application to be marketable for companies. Another area I would like to enhance is securing the database. Adding security to the database will keep the data safe and secure from possible attacks.

### Reflection

While working with databases, I re-learned how to work with MySQL. Before this course, I used MongoDB to create and connect a database to an application. However, I wanted to use MySQL to increase my knowledge. For example, I learned how to connect the database and application by coding it in my code. One of the challenges I faced this time around was time management. While researching how to connect to the MySQL database, I needed more time to write code and meet the deadline. The goal for moving forward is to find ways to stay up-to-date on techniques, skills, and database management systems.
