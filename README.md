# ePortfolio

## Welcome

Welcome to my ePortfolio. My name is Isabel Rodarte; I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science from Southern New Hampshire University. The main objective of creating my ePortfolio is to showcase my abilities, strengths, and knowledge in computer science. The ePortfolio will showcase three artifacts that have been enhanced per category: software design/engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. The enhancement per category will take the original artifact and improve it based on course outcomes.

### Code Review

Code review will consist of four significant areas of code: consistency in formatting/ overall design, quality documentation, and consistency of coding standards and project requirements. Checking within the four major areas adds quality assurance to the developed software. Code review is an essential practice for computer science professionals because it allows computer scientists to build reliable code free of errors, bugs, and issues that could hinder a project.

### Artifact Two: Algorithms and Data Structures
#### Airgead Banking App

The Airgead Banking App uses loops to calculate mathematical input and outputs in Java. It will demonstrate my ability to enhance an algorithm to improve efficiency by applying the calculation formula Math.pow and showcasing evaluating computing solutions and solving a mathematical problem using algorithmic principles.

### Artifact Three: Databases
#### Appointment Services

The Appointment Service holds clients' information such as appointment date, description, and ID. It will display my knowledge of databases, implementation within a project, and the use of well-founded tools to incorporate the database.

## Professional Self-Assesment

During my computer science journey, I gained valuable skills and learned more in-depth computer science concepts. Some of which are essential and helpful in setting professional goals. 

Course CS-260, Data Structures and Algorithms introduces the importance of data structures and algorithms as they are essential for a program to function. I gained knowledge of the importance of data structures, and without a data structure, it would be challenging to write code, maintain the code, and debug. Data structures reduce redundancy in coding, which is a crucial tool within software development. The value of this course ensures my ability to sort, manage, and store information along with efficient techniques to accomplish any operation on data.

Throughout my coursework in CS-310 Collaborating and Team Projects, I was introduced to git. Before this course, I was unfamiliar with git and its purpose. However, I have learned that git is essential in a collaborating team environment. It allows a git repository to be uploaded openly, which peers can collaborate on. Also, version control is beneficial as it tracks modifications made to the code among peers and reverses mistakes by comparing earlier code versions.

Other courses throughout my computer science program also help shape values in professional goals. I discovered the value of communication in every concept and category of computer science. For example, during CS-320 Software Test Automation & QA, the value of communicating with stakeholders in the SDLC process is essential. It builds trust, rapport, and collaboration with stakeholders. Communicating with stakeholders encourages valuable feedback, requirements, resources, and support. CS-340 Client Server Development, introduce me to MongoDB. During this course, I was required to connect MongoDB, demonstrating comprehension of programming, including adding safety features for enhancing security with the user by adding a username and password along with user permissions.

Nevertheless, my individual growth was displayed in every computer science course. I will continuously apply the knowledge gained and outlined in my ePortfolio and showcase my overall skills, techniques, and understanding of computer science.
