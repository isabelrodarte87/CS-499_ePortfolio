### Code Review Reasoning

The code review aimed to review the code and provide feedback on improving the artifact based on the enhancements outline. Code review also helps identify areas that need to be corrected and improved. While conducting my code review, much useless commenting required to be discarded. Another area for improvement was that there were two different commenting styles, confusing viewers. The Airgead Banking application solely produced outcomes in a console, which was unsuitable for companies. During my code review, I wanted to focus on the application's design and enhance it with GUI. Lastly, the original appointment system needed a database to be incorporated based on course outcomes. The feedback I gathered during my code review will be applied to both projects.
