### Code Review Reasoning

The purpose of the code review was to review code and provide feedback on how to improve the artifact based on enhancements outline. Code review also helps with identify areas that needto me corrected and improve. While conducting my code review there was a lot of useless commenting that needed to be disgard. Another issue that occur is there were two different commeting styles which can confuse viewers. The Airgead Banking application sole produce outcome in a console which was is not suitable of companies. During my code review I wanted to focus on the design of the application and enhance it with GUI. This is just some feedback I was able to gather during my code review and will all be apply to both projects moving forward.
