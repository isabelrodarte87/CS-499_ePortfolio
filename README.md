### Artifact Information

The artifact is a bank application created for Airgead Bank to help clients perform financial calculations. The artifact was generated initially during the CS-210 Programming Languages course and written in C++. As shown below, essential functions allow users to input values, perform financial calculations, and output financial results within the Visual Studio console command prompt window.

### The Enhancement

The previous enhancement tackled the design by incorporating a graphical user interface (GUI). For the second enhancement, the focus was on improving an algorithm. For this artifact, the compound interest calculations were made using a loop. Enhancing the algorithm and making it more efficient using a mathematical formula by applying Math.pow was essential. The Math.pow provides an efficient way of multiplying numbers in large quantities; the financial calculator takes user input of large numbers and outputs the end-of-year balances. Additional edits were completed to improve the overall artifact. The code naming of classes was revised to provide clarity. For example, calculationsConfigurations.java was renamed to FinancialCalculator.java, and function names were updated to represent their purpose better. Comments were corrected and modified to provide logic and meaning behind the code, for example, methods, constructors, and variables. Documentation includes headers to describe the artifact's purpose, enhancement completed and author information. Overall, making the necessary changes to the artifact provides better computer science practices that are concise and clear. 

### Meeting Course Objective

The objectives planned for this enhancement still needed to be fully met. However, the design exceeded the client's requirements. The original plan was to incorporate a data mining tool. After working on the artifact, I found that improving a mathematical formula for computing interest was better than a loop-based calculation. It met the enhancement objective; however, the original plan was to add a data mining tool, that I decided to rethink.

### Reflection

After researching how to document a Java project properly, I completed the tasks provided in the feedback. I learned that as a developer, it is essential to research as it can provide clarity and improve the coding quality. Completing this artifact for a second time, I learned it is vital to take my time and use a step-by-step method when working through my code. It is easy to make mistakes as we are human. For example, when conducting a test run, the “calculation” button was not responding when I clicked on it. Reviewing the code that adds the button, I realized it was missing the “addActionListener,” as it is essential to tell what actions are completed when the calculation button is clicked.
