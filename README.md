### Artifact Information

The “Airgead Baking Application” was created in the CS-210 programming languages course in February 2023. Originally developed using C++, the bank application aims to assess financial investments with and without deposits based on user input and calculate financial output, providing investment worth. I selected this project because the enhancement will improve it by making it practical for companies and their clients. Currently, the project uses a C++ console to handle inputs and output, which does not apply to companies and their clients. Migrating language from C++ to Java will make the application accessible on mobile devices, making it ideal for client and company use. Adding GUI provides a user-friendly environment and familiarity. 

### Artifact Selection

Implementing language migration from C++ to Java and GUI demonstrates and showcases my skills and techniques in programming, such as logical thinking, critical thinking, and code readability. With logical thinking, I could understand the primary use of the application, "mobile devices," and apply a versatile language, like Java, which can handle different platforms as it is platform-independent. Logical thinking: I recognized the application is unsuitable as it takes inputs and displays output in a console. I solved the problem by deciding to implement a GUI. Using a GUI gives the company and its clients an easy window to navigate. JFrame produced a window on the screen, along with labels, text field boxes, and a button. This also ensures my code readability, as it generated the expected results when I ran the code. Did it display a window, labels, and text fields? Yes. The course outcome I accomplished in this enhancement is CS-499-4: "Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices to implement computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals."

### Meeting Course Objective 

I was reflecting on my enrichment plan and all objectives, but one still needed to be met. After carefully considering my initial plan, I needed to take a different approach by removing graphics and creating a window that end users can easily navigate. This design change improves the artifact but also showcases the different abilities and skills I have learned. Moving forward to the next milestone, I will likely find new ways to improve the artifact. However, I am satisfied with my overall design, from language migration to creating a working window. 

### Reflection

Something that I have learned about enhancing and modifying the artifact is that the vision for the outcome of the project can change. As a computer scientist, making the best version of an application or software is essential, and sometimes, that means going back to the drawing and redesigning. But if it improves the overall outcome, stepping back and making those changes are essential and beneficial. One of my main challenges was working with JFrame to create a functioning window. Could I have stuck to my original design? Yes, but doing so, I think, it didn’t push my skills and abilities. I am unfamiliar with working with JFrame, but now that I have learned how to use it to create windows, I feel more rounded and ready to explore endless possibilities. During this enhancement, I improved by converting my calculations from C++ to Java and keeping my end user in mind. For my following enhancement, I will probably rewrite it and edit it to match, making the window and calculations code work together. Right now, I have the design and what I want the new window to accomplish, which is to display calculations and incorporate a data mining tool to give investment outcome feedback that will satisfy algorithms and data structures.
